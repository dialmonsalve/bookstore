<h1>CRM Bookstore</h1>

### This project is create in TypeScript, React 18.2, react-router-dom 6.8.1 and Redux

#### The entire project is based on my personal account, and it has two private routes and one public route. There is also a superuser who has the ability to create, update, and delete all other users managed within a JSON database using json-live-server..

#### I created all of the styles using Sass according to my own approach, and all animations are done using pure CSS.
